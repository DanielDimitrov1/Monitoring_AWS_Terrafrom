# AWS Monitoring with Terraform & Terragrunt

## Overview

This repository showcases my expertise in Terraform, Terragrunt, and AWS monitoring tools by implementing automated monitoring solutions for AWS resources. It provides infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to deploy CloudWatch alarms and other monitoring configurations efficiently and consistently.

The current setup focuses on monitoring key AWS services using Terraform and Terragrunt, ensuring scalability, modularity, and maintainability. This is a simple way of implementing monitoring, but I can enhance it using for_each loops, if statements, and other Terraform features to provide more flexibility and customization as needed.
